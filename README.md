# Classic Patternmaker

A simple automated pattern creation app

## Description

Utilizing JS and jQuery, I decided to re-create a version of the first program I ever made. It was on a TI-83 calculator back in middle school. A cursor bounced around the screen toggling pixels.

## Usage

* Download the repository and open index.html using your preferred browser.
* Enter what settins you want.
* Submit your settings and witness the resulting pattern.
* Look down the page for examples or view your creation in a new window to save as a downloaded image.
